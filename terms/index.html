        shall not be held personally responsible or liable for any actions or

        8. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES BY ARBITRATION.
      </h5>

      <p>
        YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE, CLAIM
        OR GRIEVANCE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE, BY
        ARBITRATION THAT WILL TAKE PLACE IN KINGS COUNTY, NEW YORK, UNITED
        STATES OF AMERICA AND BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION
        ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) PURSUANT TO THE AAA COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES.
        SUCH ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR WHO SHALL BE
        SELECTED BY THE APPLICABLE AAA RULES AND THE ARBITRATION HEARING SHALL
        BE HELD WITHIN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY (120) DAYS FROM THE DATE THE
        ARBITRATOR ACCEPTS HIS OR HER APPOINTMENT AS ARBITRATOR. THE
        ARBITRATOR’S DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING UPON THE PARTIES, AND
        JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE CONFIRMED AND
        ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. EACH
        PARTY SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND OTHER
        ARBITRATION COSTS. SHOULD THE AAA FIND THAT ITS CONSUMER ARBITRATION
        RULES APPLY, THE PARTIES WILL RETAIN THE RIGHT TO SEEK REMEDIES IN
        SMALL CLAIMS COURT FOR DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF
        THAT COURT. FURTHER, ANY SUCH CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE, CLAIMS AND
        GRIEVANCES WILL BE PURSUED INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION. YOU
        WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR
        AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT
        TO ARBITRATION. PLEASE NOTE THAT OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF
        YOU WENT TO COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. FOR EXAMPLE,
        THE PARTIES ARE WAIVING THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND
        PRE-ARBITRATION DISCOVERY IS GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN AND DIFFERENT
        FROM THAT AVAILABLE IN COURT PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE
        ARBITRATOR’S AWARD IS NOT REQUIRED TO INCLUDE FACTUAL FINDINGS OR
        LEGAL REASONING AND ANY PARTY’S RIGHT TO MODIFY OR SET ASIDE AN
        ARBITRATOR’S AWARD IS STRICTLY LIMITED.
      </p>

      <h5 class="section__title-small section__title-small-green">
        9. EQUITABLE RELIEF.
      </h5>

      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened
        violation of the Company’s intellectual property rights and
        confidential and proprietary information by you, the Company will
        suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive
        relief to enforce this Agreement. The Company may, without waiving any
        other remedies under this Agreement, seek from any court having
        jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional or injunctive relief
        that is necessary to protect its rights and property pending the
        outcome of the Arbitration referenced above. You consent to the
        personal and subject matter jurisdiction of the federal and state
        courts in Kings County County, New York, United States of America for
        purposes of any such action by the Company.
      </p>

      <h5 class="section__title-small section__title-small-green">
        10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
      </h5>

      <p>
        This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of
        the Parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all
        prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, inducements or
        conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between the parties.
      </p>

      <h5 class="section__title-small section__title-small-green">11. SEVERABILITY.</h5>

      <p>
        The parties shall comply with all applicable laws in performing this
        agreement. Whenever there is any conflict between any provision of
        this Agreement and any law, the law shall prevail, but in such event
        the provision effected in this Agreement shall be limited or
        eliminated only to the extent necessary, and the remainder of this
        Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h5 class="section__title-small section__title-small-green">12. NO WAIVER.</h5>

      <p>
        The failure of any party to insist on the performance of any
        obligation hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such
        obligation. Waiver of any breach of any provision shall not be deemed
        to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or any other
        provision.
