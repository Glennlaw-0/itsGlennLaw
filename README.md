# Webpage for https://itsGlennLaw.com portfolio

I will be using this webpage styling for my first portfolio. You will find sections, about me, my portfolio, blog, and my contact details. Please feel free to reach out to me for any questions or if you'd like to use this layout design. Thank you for taking the time to look at my website.

## Quickstart guide

- Clone or download this Git repo onto your computer.
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't have it yet.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gulp` to run the default Gulp task

In this proejct, Gulp is configured to run the following functions:

- Compile the SCSS files to CSS
- Autoprefix and minify the CSS file
- Concatenate the JS files
- Uglify the JS files
- Move final CSS and JS files to the `/dist` folder
